Description: This package is a set of wrapper functions for phyloseq and
    ggplot2 that turns ordinary taxonomic count data into fantaxtic,
    publication ready plots. Fantaxticfigures come as completely stylized 
    figures with pleasing colors and maximal plotting control. As the output 
    figures are simply ggplot2 objects, expert users can also manipulate the 
    final output to customize figures up to their desire.
